# Time Deposit Refactoring Kata - Take-Home Assignment

## XA Bank Time Deposit

### Context
A junior developer implemented domain logic for a time deposit system but did not complete the API functionality. Your task is to refactor the existing codebase to implement all required functionalities based on the provided business requirements, ensuring no breaking changes occur.

### Requirements

1. **API Endpoints**:
    - Create a RESTful API endpoint to update the balances of all time deposits in the database.
    - Create a RESTful API endpoint to retrieve all time deposits.
        - The GET endpoint should return a list of all time deposits with the following schema:
            - `id`
            - `planType`
            - `balance`
            - `days`
            - `withdrawals`

2. **Database Setup**:
    - Store all time deposit plans in a database.
    - Define the following tables:
        - `timeDeposits`:
            - `id`: Integer (primary key)
            - `planType`: String (required)
            - `days`: Integer (required)
            - `balance`: Decimal (required)
        - `withdrawals`:
            - `id`: Integer (primary key)
            - `timeDepositId`: Integer (foreign key, required)
            - `amount`: Decimal (required)
            - `date`: Date (required)

3. **Interest Calculation**:
    - Implement logic to calculate monthly interest based on the plan type:
        - **Basic Plan**: 1% interest
        - **Student Plan**: 3% interest (no interest after 1 year)
        - **Premium Plan**: 5% interest (interest starts after 45 days)
    - No interest is applied for the first 30 days for any existing plans.

4. **Refactoring Constraints**:
    - Do not introduce breaking changes to the shared `TimeDeposit` class or modify the `updateBalance` method signature.
    - Ensure the design is extensible to accommodate future complexities in interest calculations.

5. **Code Quality**:
    - Adhere to SOLID principles, design patterns, and clean code practices where applicable.

### Important Guidelines
- The existing `TimeDepositCalculator.updateBalance` method is functioning correctly. Ensure its behavior remains unchanged after refactoring.
- The final solution must include **exactly two API endpoints**. Do not develop additional endpoints.
- **Do not** create a pull request or a new branch in the ikigai-digital repository. Instead, fork the repository into your own GitHub repository and develop the solution there.
- Handling invalid input or exceptions is not required.
- Use any tools, frameworks, or libraries you find suitable.
- In case of ambiguity, make logical assumptions and justify them in code comments.

### Preferred Stack
- Use an OpenAPI Swagger contract.
- Embrace Hexagonal Architecture.
- Follow atomic commit practices.
- Utilize testcontainers.

### Submission Instructions
- Provide clear instructions on how to trigger the endpoints using the Swagger contract.
- Email the link to your public GitHub repository.
